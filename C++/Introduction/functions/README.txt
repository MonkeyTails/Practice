You have to write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

+= : Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
a += b is equivalent to a = a + b;

Input Format

Input will contain four integers - a,b,c,d, one in each line.

Output Format

Print the greatest of the four integers.
PS: I/O will be automatically handled.
