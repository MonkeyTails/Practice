Input Format

You will be given two positive integers, a and b (a <= b), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer in the interval [a,b]:

    If a <= n <= 9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
    Else if n > 9 and it is an even numeber, then print "even".
    Else if n > 9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

Note: [a,b] = {x in integers | a <= x <= b} = {a, a+1, ..., b}
